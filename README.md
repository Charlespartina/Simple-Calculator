### Features
1. Exception Handling for "divide by zero", "initial digit is 0 for multi-digits number", "operand or operator cannot correctly match."
2. There will always be a "0" showing on the screen when opening the calculator or when clicking on "AC".
3. If an integer or a mathematical expression has so many digits, operands or operators that cannot be contained within the black screen of the calculator, then the integer or the mathematical expression showing on the screen will move to the left whenever a new digit or operator is added, and the foremost digit or operator will be removed from the screen, but the value of the integer and the meaning of the mathematical expression remain unchanged since they are implicitly stored.

## Console Calculator
This calculator can evaluate multiple mathematical expressions from an input file and output the results in another file.
